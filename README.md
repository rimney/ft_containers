# ft_containers - Custom C++ STL Containers Implementation

## Overview
"ft_containers" is a C++ project that involves re-implementing some of the standard containers provided by the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). The project aims to recreate the functionalities of key containers, including Vector, Stack, and Map, to deepen your understanding of container design and data structures.

## Project Scope
The "ft_containers" project involves implementing the following custom containers:
- **Vector**: A dynamic array that provides dynamic resizing and random access capabilities similar to std::vector in STL.
- **Stack**: A LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) data structure, similar to std::stack in STL.
- **Map**: An associative container that stores key-value pairs and maintains a sorted order based on keys, akin to std::map in STL.

## Purpose
The primary purpose of "ft_containers" is to enhance your understanding of data structures, algorithms, and container design principles in C++. By creating your custom versions of these STL containers, you'll gain insights into how they work under the hood, the underlying data representations, and the trade-offs made to achieve various functionalities.

## Key Learning Objectives
The "ft_containers" project aims to achieve the following key learning objectives:
- **Container Design**: Understand the architecture and design of essential containers like Vector, Stack, and Map.
- **Data Structures**: Implement data structures to support container functionalities efficiently.
- **Algorithms**: Develop algorithms for container operations such as insertion, deletion, and searching.
- **Iterators**: Create custom iterators to traverse and manipulate container elements.
- **Memory Management**: Explore dynamic memory allocation and deallocation strategies for resizable containers.

## Repository Structure
In your project repository, you may find the following components:
- **src**: The folder containing the source code for your custom container implementations.
- **includes**: The folder containing the header files for your containers.
- **tests**: Test cases and scripts to validate the correctness of your container implementations.

## Conclusion
The "ft_containers" project provides an exciting opportunity to delve into the inner workings of essential C++ STL containers. By completing this project, you'll enhance your C++ programming skills, deepen your knowledge of data structures and algorithms, and gain valuable insights into container design and implementation.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
